# brno-part-budget
This repository aims to provide data for visualisation of projects submitted to [Participatory Budget in Brno, Czech Rep](https://damenavas.brno.cz/).

To do that, the script:
* Downloads data about participatory budget projects through API
* Scrapes data about public votes from a webpage
* Joins and cleans the data
* Pushes the resulting dataset into a Google spreadsheet

Hosting and scheduling of the script is managed via GitHub and the final visualisation is performed via [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/).

Visit the resulting [interactive dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/ParticipativnrozpoetmstaBrna_17177050818370/NavigationDB) and give it a whirl!
